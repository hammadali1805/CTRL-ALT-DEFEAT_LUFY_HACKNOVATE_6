## üåü Project Overview

**LUFY** provides an intuitive platform for simplifying complex legal documents into concise summaries and supporting multiple languages. The platform serves legal professionals, clients, and anyone seeking clarity on legal jargon by providing **abstractive and extractive summaries**, improving accessibility to legal content.

Users can:
- Upload documents in PDF, TXT, DOCX formats.  
- Receive summarized content in multiple local languages.  
- Use a chatbot to query documents in natural language.  
- Get sentence-level importance scores using a regression model for extractive summarization.

## üí° Key Features

- **Abstractive & Extractive Summaries**: Uses advanced models for high-quality summaries.
- **Sentence Scoring via ML**: A Keras regression model trained on legal data scores each sentence from 0 to 1 based on importance.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Summaries can be translated to Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, and more.
- **Query Understanding via LLM**: Lightweight LLM-based chatbot enables smart document Q&A.
- **File Format Support**: Accepts PDF, TXT, DOCX files.
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Designed to run on low-resource environments.
